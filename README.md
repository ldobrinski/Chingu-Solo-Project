# Requirements
1. Explore the Conquer Template demo, then download it (FREE) to your computer
2. Make files for your app, such as an index.html, stylesheet, and .js file.
3. Make sure you have HTML containers for each section. For instance a navigation, header, footer, sections, divs
4. Footer section with your developer information
### style
1. Cloning means to create a web page with a layout as identical as possible to the template.
2. Choose some images for your template sections at Unsplash or another free image/video site
3. Which fonts and colors do you want to use? Add these and media queries (to look good on mobile) to your stylesheet, which you need to add to your index.html
4. For the card sections of the page, categories, etc. decide on a layout strategy and use it consistently, such as CSS Grid and/or Flexbox
5. Design your buttons and other elements. Remember to use a consistent design so buttons all look like buttons, links all look like links, etc.
### functionality
1. Make your buttons scroll to the page sections. The scrolling that gracefully eases in instead of jumps is a good thing to try with JavaScript
2. Implement a Parallax effect for your page.
### Other
1. Your repo needs to have a robust README.md
2. Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before submitting
