## Requirements
- Explore the Conquer Template demo, then download it (FREE) to your computer
- Make files for your app, such as an index.html, stylesheet, and .js file.
-  Make sure you have HTML containers for each section. For instance a navigation, header, footer, sections, divs
-  Footer section with your developer information
# style
-  Cloning means to create a web page with a layout as identical as possible to the template.
- Choose some images for your template sections at Unsplash or another free image/video site
- Which fonts and colors do you want to use? Add these and media queries (to look good on mobile) to your stylesheet, which you need to add to your index.html
- For the card sections of the page, categories, etc. decide on a layout strategy and use it consistently, such as CSS Grid and/or Flexbox
- Design your buttons and other elements. Remember to use a consistent design so buttons all look like buttons, links all look like links, etc.
# functionality
-  Make your buttons scroll to the page sections. The scrolling that gracefully eases in instead of jumps is a good thing to try with JavaScript
- Implement a Parallax effect for your page.
# Other
- Your repo needs to have a robust README.md
- Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before submitting
