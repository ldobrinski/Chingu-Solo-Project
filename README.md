-  Cloning means to create a web page with a layout as identical as possible to the template.
- Choose some images for your template sections at Unsplash or another free image/video site
- Which fonts and colors do you want to use? Add these and media queries (to look good on mobile) to your stylesheet, which you need to add to your index.html
- For the card sections of the page, categories, etc. decide on a layout strategy and use it consistently, such as CSS Grid and/or Flexbox
- Design your buttons and other elements. Remember to use a consistent design so buttons all look like buttons, links all look like links, etc.
